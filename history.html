        <div class="contents">Preamble</div>
        <div class="money">
          Well we just started our 20+th year of the NJCO Fantasy Football
          league (you start losing count after a certain period)! Yes, it has had different names in the past, and members have
          come and gone, but it still has had some core elements. I thought it
          would be fun to take a look back at the previous 20+ years, the drama,
          the rule changes, and just the evolution of the game that we enjoy so
          much today. For you relatively new guys, it's also a chance to see why
          things are done in certain ways as well. Enjoy! <br /><br />
          Pre-Story is I was introduced to the world of Fantasy Sports through a
          summer visit from my good ol' friend Matt Hayduk in 1996. The website
          was SmallWorld Sports, and he taught me about Fantasy Baseball and I
          was hooked right away. During that fall, I attempted to start my own
          Fantasy Football league at my middle-school lunch table. (I still had
          the notebook of the first draft as of a couple of years ago :) It was
          an utter disaster though as manually calculating stats was just too
          time consuming. My friend Jay Tsui though had introduced me to
          Sandbox.com and their fantasy football. I was in a league with him and
          his friends for two years, with in which was fun but I thought could
          be better.
        </div>
        <div class="contents">1999-2002<br />(The Sandbox Years)</div>
        <div class="money">
          I found out how to run a league at Sandbox and asked a few of my
          friends if they wanted in... this included Matt, Dan Morales, TJ
          Smith, Dave Parenti, and Jay Tsui. I distinctly remember Jay bragging
          about how he got Terrell Davis, Randy Moss, and Steve Young in the
          draft and that his team was "GOD LIKE!". Davis blew out his knee,
          Young only played three games, and Moss had a slight sophomore slump.
          Jay would leave the league following that year. The next few years the
          games were played using Sandbox.com's scoring system, which included
          individual defensive players. Others joined the league, along the
          likes of Tony, Big Matt, and Jeff I believe. Drafts would consistently
          see guys like Derrick Brooks and Ray Lewis go in the top three rounds-
          it was fun. Logos were introduced and when stats came out on Monday
          Morning, most of us would race to the computer to see who had won. I
          can't remember who was Champions during this time and Sandbox is no
          longer around for research- but this was when the league really
          started to take off. The league switched from points only to
          head-to-head and did lose members TJ Smith, Dave Parenti, Matt Egan,
          and a small handful of others due to lack of participation.

        <div class="contents">2003<br />(First Season at Yahoo!)</div>
        <div class="money">
          Sandbox, in it's infinite wisdom, decided to start to try and squeeze
          money out of it's members during the 2002 season. All regular features
          that used to be free started to cost money except for the league. I
          started to look for free options and it came down between
          CBSsportsline.com and Yahoo. I did a test run of leagues in Yahoo
          during 2002 and loved their layout... Sandbox went full-pay in 2003
          and the league jumped ship to Yahoo! Pete, Luke, Naveen Swamy, and Big
          Al/Travis all joined the league. Individual defensive players were
          replaced with team defenses. Jeff romped through this season going
          15-2 setting an all-time record for wins <s>that can never be beat due to
          future changes</s> was technically matched by SOB in 2023's "cruise control" season. Best team name: Sneaky Fire Spitters (Pete)

        <div class="contents">2004<br />(Huge Changes Year)</div>
        <div class="money">
          This year was the first year of doing playoffs, actually having a
          prize pool (in which the rule of "if you go undefeated you get ALL OF
          THE MONEY" was established - and still stands), and was by far the most
          hotly debated ending to the season. Most of us were working at
          Elephant Wireless that summer leading into the season, and trash talk
          started early. Tom Leon joined the league as well as Ian, who's entry
          was hotly debated. In order to keep even teams, Naveen Swamy was
          removed from the league as there was overwhelming support to keep the
          league more Edison focused and Luke didn't sign up. The end of the
          season saw much controversy as Big Matt had dropped marquee names in
          which Lil Matt was trying to pick up for the playoffs. This came with
          much debate over the can't cut list and some locking of teams. Ian had
          also made a splash right away, making it all the way to the
          Championship game in his first year. His run ended as I took the first
          ever playoff championship after squeaking by on a tie-break win vs Lil
          Matt in the first round due to an Alge Crumpler fumble. This game was
          the reason fractional points were introduced.<br /><br />Best team

        <div class="contents">2005<br />(The Last Expansion and KEEPERS!!)</div>
        <div class="money">
          This season saw the league expand to the full 12-teams that you see
          now. The addition of Chris aka "Eggy" and the re-entry of TJ Smith
          brought the league up to that number and a new "Keeper Rule" was
          approved by the league (two). The league also did a draft-lottery for
          the first time as we knew the 12-team limit was set in stone now- this
          would curb anybody from intentionally tanking the end of the year. The
          draft was probably the most talked about and anticipated of the
          league's history as it was the last one with complete free reign of
          players to pick from. As the league went on, this was also the first
          year of locking playoff teams from adding (after the debacle at the
          end of 2004). Big Matt took home his first championship in a close
          championship over myself as TJ Duckett rode the bench for me for some
          reason.<br /><br />Best Team Name: CockItToTheRight

        <div class="money">
          2006 was a sad year as we saw the passing of an original Lil Matt
          Hayduk. His brother Luke took over his team and the league was changed
          forever. We tried to spruce up the draft by doing a live in-person
          draft for the first time at Nan's house- this was the only time we'd
          ever try this. The smack talk was still around and rivalries still
          existed, but something has lacked in the league since. A four-way tie
          for 3rd place forced two 8-6 teams to miss the playoffs, and the other
          two Big Matt and Jeff finished #1/#2 after all was said and done. Rule
          changes were proposed- such as a salary cap structure w/ auction draft
          and unlocking of playoff teams, but no rules were actually changed.<br /><br />Best

          The 2007 season had a raise in the entry fee (from $20 to $30) and a
          failed pursuit of a 3-peat by Big Matt, but will probably be best
          known for the heated trash talk for that year's Black Friday Bowl.
          Multiple posts went back and forth about who should be captains,
          ending gloriously with myself and Tony shutting out Jeff's team that
          Black Friday. As for the fantasy side of things, Jeff did get his
          revenge as he and his Tom Brady led team won the championship over
          Dan... my own team, despite being far superior in the regular season,
          finished out of the money. Best Team Name:<br /><br />Real Men of

        <div class="money">
          This season saw the removal of Eggy and the welcomed addition of Greg
          into the league. The season itself was pretty typical, with no changes
          made, but was highlighted by two of the biggest trades to ever go down
          in the league. I had traded not only Chris Johnson/Tony Gonzalez for
          Gates/Roddy White but also Adrian Peterson for Tomlinson straight up.
          The moves helped me make the championship game but only to be denied a
          title by Big Matt. Best Team Name:<br /><br />Randy Marsh... nuff

        <div class="money">
          The playoffs from 2008 had come down to a kicker on Monday Night
          between Jeff and I. Watching the game at Tony's house, we both looked
          at each other and went... welp, it's a complete crap shoot huh? We
          then decided shortly after to remove kickers from the league as they
          are probably the most unpredictable asset of any fantasy team,
          regardless of sport. Anthony Rispoli was welcomed into the league to
          replace an inactive TJ Smith this year as well. Ian claimed the title
          after winning the first round with the smallest margin of victory ever
          in a playoff game (fractional point era). The record book was
          introduced and still has some records that stand present day (and
          probably won't ever be beat- like Pete's high score *This was
          eventually topped in 2019).<br /><br />Best Team Name: S Lyle's True

        <div class="money">
          2010 was probably the year in which the league was most shaken up in
          devastating ways. The league started off fantastically with a draft
          occurring at the Rispoli house. This was one of the first times in
          years we had the majority of the league together on draft day. During
          the season though we had the unexpected death of Anthony Rispoli, in
          which Pete would take over his team... to this day, he has been the
          only manager approved of managing two teams at once. Just a couple of
          weeks after though, Pete had also unexpectedly passed away. The league
          was very somber during the championship weeks, Tony had claimed his
          first ever title in the end.<br /><br />Best Team Name: All Day

        <div class="contents">2011<br />(Ch-ch-ch-changes)</div>
        <div class="money">
          With what had occurred the previous year, the league had to add two
          replacement members. Tommy Cohen and Chris Martin made the cut. With the addition of
          two new members, other changes had been proposed that made fantastic
          sense. The trading of draft picks brought about a whole new way of
          trading... waivers from first-game thru Tuesday brought about a level
          playing field instead of rewarding those with the computer closest to
          them... and the creation of conferences and rivalries brought a whole
          new twist to how the game is played. The 12-team league had been split
          into two conferences, mainly determined by the rivalries that had
          developed over the years. Teams would play all of their conference
          foes twice, three out of conference games, and their rival- not once,
          not twice, but three times. The conferences themselves were named in
          remembrance of our dear friends Matt Hayduk and Pete and Anthony
          Rispoli. The season, at least to me, brought about a new level of
          energy not felt since the '05 season. Chris Martin took home the 'ship
          in his first year, overcoming an 8-6 regular season. Maybe he had a
          little help from up above?<br /><br />Best Team Name: I cut my Bush

          finally put it all together. A draft which saw Tony draft Michael
          Turner in the first round (Michael Turner???) then saw a dominant
          11-win season put together by Jeff. He faced off against Rispoli Champ
          Team Crawford in an epic championship match while Travis, who's team
          put up a measly 52.57 points in the first round playoff loss, claimed

          playoffs as both Sean and Greg made the championship game. In what was
          only decided by 7 points, Greg claimed the first back-to-back
          championships since Big Matt did the trick back in 05-06! Guess who

          Fantasy football doesn't always work out perfect, some weeks some
          teams just get lucky. 2014 proved this big time as Tony's
          record-setting team, who was stacked, somehow choked away a first
          round playoff matchup to a team he had nearly 400 more points on
          during the season! Then, on the other matchup, Jeff put up a whopping
          57 points... and WON BY DOUBLE DIGITS over a 10-win Team Crawford
          looking for the three-peat. Jeff then went on to claim another title
          for the "Big 3" over Sean Kenney while Tony put up a score for third
          that would have easily won him the championship. Price is right

          undefeated and take home ALL THE MONEY! All of this AFTER keeping

          11, and another in 13... and before you know it he was losing in the

          Going into the 2017 season the league knew that some things just had
          to change. The days of putting up with dead-weight teams needed to
          end, and unbalanced schedules needed to be addressed as well, amongst
          other things. The commish called for the first ever "Summer meetings"
          to discuss and vote on possible rule changes. For those that showed,
          some interesting topics were debated and a multitude of changes swept
          into the league. We first saw the addition of Tyler and Cerca into the
          league as the first change. Then defensive scoring was updated that
          saw the greatest pushback this league may ever see! Conferences were
          split into THREE for the first time as well as a wild-card format that
          looked to solve any bad-luck scheduling. Talk about a period of
          adjustment... this was one. But the league pulled through it! We had
          the most successful season to date as a record setting number of
          trades occured (along with the new non-snake draft picks the following
          season), our first-ever "Pick your opponent" playoff system piqued
          curiosity, and a late keeper declaration allowed a little bit of
          breathing room for all during the preseason. Tony wound up with his
          first championship since 2010 in the end and a new more open league
          changes voting system was developed for the following season.<br /><br />Best

          We welcomed in yet another new member as the previous year's "Dead
          Team" rule took effect. Sean Leary joined the league as it's 27th
          overall member replacing veteran Sean Kenney. New rule changes took
          effect as a modified defensive scoring system was implimented as well
          as an offensive scoring adjustment that reduced the importance of the
          TD as many members felt it was too heavily skewed to. Tony's team
          rampaged through the schedule setting a record for points, but was cut
          down by a red-hot "Kupp Check" team in the Championship. This season
          may best be remembered though for an insane number of childish vetos
          during the most critical time of the year, the trade deadline. Fair
          trades were shot down, lopsided trades were let through- the wild west
          didn't have anything on this league- which was a shame! Changes are
          coming to rectify that though. The league saw long time member Chris
          Martin bid adieu.<br /><br />Best Team Name: Off Constantly

          After the debacle of the previous year's veto-frenzy, the NJCO tension
          peaked. After a close league wide vote, it was determined that no
          longer would the fate of trades be in other owners hands. The days of
          the "instant trade" were born! The days of spite-vetos, "I could have
          offered better" vetoes, and just plain troll-vetoing came to an end.
          Owners were now free to make whatever moves they wanted as long as it
          wasn't a blatantly obvious collusive move. To also help out the bottom
          feeders of the leage, optional keepers became a thing. Owners could
          now decide to not keep anybody AND in the process trade 1st and 2nd
          round picks. This opened up a whole new world of offers being made, of
          which 20 were accepted!<br /><br />The season itself saw the "To Be
          Named" conference dominate the regular season with 3 of its 4 teams
          finishing above .500 and also seeing the Champion come out of it as
          well (Tommy C).<br /><br />Best Team Name: MPD Little Guy

          Coronavirus! The worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 threatened if there
          would even be a 2020 season! There was, but it wasn't very normal to
          start. Outbreaks caused teams schedules to be mixed up, we had some
          players opt out, and somehow Tom Brady won another Super Bowl at the
          age of 100. On the NJCO front, everybody finally got a taste of what
          optional keepers was like as the draft caught quite a few of them off
          guard. Then MONSTER trades went down during the season as multiple 1st
          and 2nd round picks traded hands. The playoffs saw the move of the
          century by Tom Leon, benching Russell Wilson for
          Ryan-freakin'-Tannehill, which squeaked him past Tony and into the
          Championship vs the defending champ Tommy Cohen. Tommy C eventually
          did come out on top for the repeat in one of the most balanced years
          we've ever had. No team had double-digit wins or double-digit losses!
          We also saw the most trades executed in a single year with 21!<br /><br />Best

          The year of Kupp - Cooper Kupp had an absolutely dominating season and
          the team named after him cruised to yet another Championship...
          despite not having him. Tommy had the benefit of drafting Jonathan
          Taylor and watching the Colts running back go crazy in the second half
          of the season- despite the Colts not making the playoffs. Just like
          the owner of Cooper Kupp, Tyler, somehow missed the playoffs as well!
          Tyler also had Deebo Samuel.. so the top two WRs, and yeah. Tony had a
          fortunate first three weeks and then traded away his entire 2022 draft
          again just to fall in the playoffs and only win "the hug".<br /><br />Best

          "I OWN YOU!" - Travis's team was putting up a season for the ages,
          blowing away just about everybody in his way with ease, and barely
          making a single move to his roster in the process! But then, in a
          blink of an eye, it all came crashing down. Team "Back in Black" had
          finally flipped the script and went from a perennial last place team
          to a dominant wrecking ball. A wrecking ball though that got dented by
          Sean Leary's "Uncle Dad" along the way. When playoff time came, Travis
          set out to avenge his one single loss all year only for Uncle Dad to
          go full "Aaron Rodgers vs the Bears" on him with yet ANOTHER painful
          loss, bouncing Travis to the consolation matchup in the process.
          Sean's team though would face a red hot Team Crawford in the
          Championship, who blitzed his way to a yet another title with a solid
          smackdown. Tom Leon also made the playoffs with his best team ever
          assembled, yet he fell short twice and wound up with only a hug
          himself. Greg became the only 4x NJCO Champion in the process!<br /><br />Best

          Cruise Control - In what may go down as the single greatest season in
          NJCO history, SOB's "Sandy Hookers" did something that's never been
          done before... defeat every single team in the league. SOB claimed his
          third Championship with a final record of 15-1, avenging that only
          loss with a victory over Cerca in the first round of the playoffs. We
          saw the entire Rispoli divison dominate the OOC schedule creating yet
          another scenario where a 10-4 Tyler missed the playoffs. Tommy Cohen
          made his way back to the Championship game but was ultimately
          disappointed as Stefon Diggs became contagious with poor point totals
          and he got to the whole team. And to close, we finally saw somethign
          we ain't never seen before- Tony actually trading FOR draft picks (but
          it was really weird because he totally could have made a run at the
          Wild Card so... shrug?).<br /><br />Best Team Name: Rainbow Randolph's
