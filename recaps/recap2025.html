      <div class="titles">2025 Draft Recap</div>
      <div class="money">
        Here we are, a quarter of the way into the century and this league is still going strong! So first and foremost, thank you all for making this league something I, and all of us, continue to look forward to each year. And now for the part we've all been waiting for- the draft recap!
        <br /><br />
        As always, this is all in good fun- don't take any of the criticisms or praise to heart, just having some fun. Outside of politics, this year hasn't had many major themes for the masses that was easy to play off of, so I narrowed it down to two ideas. The first was "Greatest Comedy Movies of All-Time", which could be fun and we'd all do quotes and such back and forth. However that theme is more evergreen instead of being specific to the year.
        <br><br>
        So this year I looked at what was the best thing I've seen in comedy so far. Happy Gilmore 2? Noooo, that sucked and was very disappointing. The new Naked Gun? I... haven't seen it yet so I can't say, but I've heard good things. No no, what stands out above all the rest so far is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@renshawjay">"The Chit Show"</a>. So if you haven't seen it- well stop reading this and enjoy some good laughs and absolute weirdness (and yes, SPOLER ALERTS ahead!). 
        <br><br>
        Oh, and one last thing, this year you'll notice that I'm only focusing on everybody's Top 3 or maybe 4 players. I'm doing this as it's in line with my philosophy that the draft outside of the first 3-rounds really means nothing. Rounds 4-7 are basically just crap-shoots. We could do them randomly and the league would look similar... this league is won in your talent evaluation of the elites. So let's crunch some numbers and get back to it!
        <ul>
          <li class="space">
            <b>Jack - Is There a Black Person Here?</b><br />
            Oh where it all started- for most people in relation to seeing their first Chit video. Yes it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMCnnLJ2Xgg">Episode 7</a> but it was the first one that went super viral and crushed. Jack's team has that same impact- his keepers already gave him possible the #1 and #2 RBs in the entire league and then he goes and adds Conner to thin out the rest of the RBs we all can get. His potential fourth big advantage <i>could</i> be Travis Kelce. Yes, he's been slowed up a bit, but KC is getting their other weapons back full-time and he may rise up to the top of the TE charts again- but we'll have to see for our own eyes to know for sure- like the purse in the video.<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/blpurse.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Tony - He Bet Everything</b><br />
            So Tony won last year- he found his black Queen to finally complete his royal flush but did so during the game and not after like Chit did in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8uQM14z7Uw">Episode 19</a>. In doing so though, Tony left himself with very little for this year. He's still ponying up money to play this year, but why? For fun? He kept Henry, who's dancing on a cliff that RBs fall off of, and then Achane from a team that cycles through RBs like DiCaprio does with teenage girlfriends. Remember when Mostert was going in the first rounds? It wasn't that long agao at all! Anyways, Tony has A LOT of trading to do if he wants to have any competency at QB, WR, or TE and those two RBs are probably not going to be league winners this year. He's in for a potentially long season of rebuilding.<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/chitpoker.png"> 
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Tyler - Caught Him Drinking at Work</b><br />
            Well Tyler has said he's been more hungover at the draft each year. Did he wake up and drink some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqqd5rin490">"juice"</a> too because they were out of Dr Pepper at the 7-11 before this draft? He had kept nobody so he had work to do, but picking St. Brown over Jeanty is going to haunt him for years, just sayin'. Bucky Irving's value comes from how much you can squeeze out of Tony, however Tony might actually say he's rebuilding again after he realized the last time he didn't trade away his whole draft that he won the entire thing. Hall and McConkey may have some potential to be difference makers but it's slim. I don't think Ty has the worst team here, but I also don't see him finishing above .500.<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/claws.png">

          <li class="space">
            <b>Travis - Pink Pony Club</b
            ><br />
            Some may look at Travis's team and feel embarassed for him, but I think he's more than content with what it is and will wear it proudly. Two WRs that could finish in the Top 5 and Hurts at QB, which could be another Top 3-type season with all of the pushes of the tushes. Those three players will keep Trav in every game and he can go dancing at the Pink Pony Club (and then to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHIail0wJyQ">Subway right after</a>).<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/pony.png">

            <b>Tony - Australian Breakdancer</b><br />
            I guess I have to transition from the best to the worst. For the first time in YEARS Tony actually had draft picks ahead of round 13! You'd think he'd be razor sharp on getting some great players, but all those years off must have left him rusty. He looked lost, even Yahoo has him projected to finish 4-10! I mean it gets that way when you draft like it's 2019 instead of 2024. In a league that's been dominated by WR heavy teams in recent years, Tony decides "nah, FOUR straight RBs to start my draft". Goes up and grabs the JETS defense at 107? Then, like the breakdancer, we all thought maybe, just maybe they could redeem themselves with something really good at the end... but no, Tony drafts some dude out of <s>Alabama</s> no wait <s>Michigan</s> no wait New Hampshire??? At least he's playing for a solid plug-n-play offense... wait, he's on the Raiders? Wow... just wow.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%205.57.47%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725314277669">

            <b>Schteve - Leon Marchand</b><br />
            "Whoa whoa whoa Sean- comparing Schteve's draft to one of the top athletes in all of the Olympics?? Trying to suck up to the new guy to fleece him later or something huh?"- that answer is plainly no. This is more along the lines of being handed a terrible draft option from a guy named "Leon" and then just trying to be good at ONE THING (swimming is really just one event chopped into 58 different things), and that one thing was drafting "okay" RBs. Guy seriously took not one, not two, not three, but keep going... SEVEN of them. That's impressive I must say. How that'll turn out is anybody's guess as they get hurt constantly in the NFL, but otherwise I just don't see him going very far with Brock Purdy at QB- his backup, Rodgers, I'd probably take before him.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%206.15.53%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725315368653">

          <li class="space">
            <b>Travis - Quincy Hall's Strained 400m</b><br />
            Travis went out and did what you should do- give it all your best and grab as many top WRs as you can, then sprinkle in an elite QB and boom, you are looking at a lot of W's in front of you. Just like Quincy Hall coming around the final turn, a lot of us had doubts if Travis would ever return to the playoffs after apparently selling his soul for <i>finally</i>an appearance two years ago. I even gave him high praise last year before JJ's injury derailed his season. But he seems to be straining and giving it his "Hall" by the results of this years draft. My only question is if he knows how little rookie WRs tend to produce their first year (they aren't all JJ's and Nacua's).<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%208.10.25%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725322235595">

          <li class="space">
            <b>Jack - Snoop Dogg</b><br />
            Jack is riding high- not like "high in the standings" but just "high and enjoying life". You kind of need to be that way when you draft the way he did. His whole team is kind of banking on Cooper Kupp to return to a once-in-a-lifetime season, which I don't particuallary think will happen, but I could be wrong. The rest of his roster is a bunch of middle-tier-at-best players and Jordan Love was taken wayyy to high for my Bears fan taste. Also, Taysom Hill as your TE means like two weeks of 16 pts and 11 other nothing-burgers, but so be it.<img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%208.13.47%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725323716126">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Greg - Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles</b><br />
            Greg, like Tommy, has the track record to outshine anything negative I can say here... but that's not going to stop me from doing so anyway. His team, like Greg Focker's stock portfolio, is "strong, to quite strong", no doubt. However he's got a little bit of weakness at QB (I'm not sold on Richardson), a little bit of an aging keeper in CMC with an injury risk, and his WRs tend to be number... twos (insert Dr. Evil meme here). So like Biles and Chiles, he has <b>serious</b> potential to do some <b>big</b> damage, but may wind up faltering and missing out on the gold in the end (or missing out completely after a last second stat correction by Yahoo).<img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%208.59.10%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725325675042">

            <b>Kevin - Anna Hall's Heptathlon</b><br />
            The new kid is coming in fresh off of winning our Dyansty Hockey league and is looking to continue success on for the next generation. However his draft, much like Anna Hall's heptathlon, came up a bit disappointing. Keeping Kyren Williams to start was risky and looks, as of right now, as an awful choice. Grabbing Nico Collins as high as he did makes me think he knows something we all don't- not saying Collins won't be good, but you want something a little more sured of being great at that position. However Tony bailed him out with head-scratchers before his next pick came- so he went with... Mike Evans? Hmm. Kevin's whole draft is littered with guys who were more relevant a couple of years ago than this upcoming season. His whole draft feels like Anna Hall's javelin throw- he thought it was really good but in the end won't amount to much at all.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%209.16.38%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725326650279">

            <b>Seph - Noah Lyles and his COVID</b><br />
            We have another 7-RB drafter in Seph as he actually went FIVE STRAIGHT PICKS taking RBs at one point. Guys, it's 2024 not 2006- RBs are incredibly risky and phased out by RBBCs... why are we still treating them like the Ladanian Tomlinson days? Anyways, Seph's quality in this draft was very much like the 100m dash... great and over fast. His Top 3 picks were spot on and should keep him in a lot of games. After that though he slowed down like Lyles did when he got COVID. Why anybody would draft a Raider is a mystery as they might be the worst offense of all-time. To name your team after one of the players, ok, you do you. Bowers isn't going up against tiny college LBs each week now on a stacked Georgia team. Lyles still got bronze though in the 200m though so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%209.25.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725327387647">

            <b>SOB - Steph Curry and Team USA</b
            ><br />
             What can I say, just like Steph, this guy can't miss! Nailed every pick despite having two huge gaps to wait through. Two <b>ELITE</b> keeper WRs, the #1 QB, his #1 WR (now that Kelce is breaking down), and <b>EIGHT</b> total WRs- which should have been nine but I really think Juwan Johnson is basically a WR playing TE so. You all also let Jayden Daniels slip ALL THE WAY to pick 150?!? Insane and I'm glad to roster him just to block all of you from probably top 5 QB numbers by year's end. And the Bears defense, c'mon guys! I was going to write this season off- just had the greatest season ever last year and had a drooling baby distracting me throughout this thing, but I guess not- keep on keepin' on I guess. You shouldn't have woken the Sleeping Babies... now don't let them get hot!<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%2010.00.22%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725328839939">
