      <div class="money">
        Here we are, a quarter of the way into the century and this league is still going strong! So first and foremost, thank you all for making this league something I, and all of us, continue to look forward to each year. And now for the part we've all been waiting for- the draft recap!
        <br /><br />
        As always, this is all in good fun- don't take any of the criticisms or praise to heart, just having some fun. Outside of politics, this year hasn't had many major themes for the masses that was easy to play off of, so I narrowed it down to two ideas. The first was "Greatest Comedy Movies of All-Time", which could be fun and we'd all do quotes and such back and forth. However that theme is more evergreen instead of being specific to the year.
        <br><br>
        So this year I looked at what was the best thing I've seen in comedy so far. Happy Gilmore 2? Noooo, that sucked and was very disappointing. The new Naked Gun? I... haven't seen it yet so I can't say, but I've heard good things. No no, what stands out above all the rest so far is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@renshawjay">"The Chit Show"</a>. So if you haven't seen it- well stop reading this and enjoy some good laughs and absolute weirdness (and yes, SPOLER ALERTS ahead!). 
        <br><br>
        Oh, and one last thing, this year you'll notice that I'm only focusing on everybody's Top 3 or maybe 4 players. I'm doing this as it's in line with my philosophy that the draft outside of the first 3-rounds really means nothing. Rounds 4-7 are basically just crap-shoots. We could do them randomly and the league would look similar... this league is won in your talent evaluation of the elites. So let's crunch some numbers and get back to it!
        <ul>
          <li class="space">
            <b>Jack - Is There a Black Person Here? (rating: 8.5)</b><br />
            Oh where it all started- for most people in relation to seeing their first Chit video. Yes it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMCnnLJ2Xgg">Episode 7</a> but it was the first one that went super viral and crushed. Jack's team has that same impact- his keepers already gave him possible the #1 and #2 RBs in the entire league and then he goes and adds Conner to thin out the rest of the RBs we all can get. His potential fourth big advantage <i>could</i> be Travis Kelce. Yes, he's been slowed up a bit, but KC is getting their other weapons back full-time and he may rise up to the top of the TE charts again- but we'll have to see for our own eyes to know for sure- like the purse in the video.<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/blpurse.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Tony - He Bet Everything (3.5)</b><br />
            So Tony won last year- he found his black Queen to finally complete his royal flush but did so during the game and not after like Chit did in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8uQM14z7Uw">Episode 19</a>. In doing so though, Tony left himself with very little for this year. He's still ponying up money to play this year, but why? For fun? He kept Henry, who's dancing on a cliff that RBs fall off of, and then Achane from a team that cycles through RBs like DiCaprio does with teenage girlfriends. Remember when Mostert was going in the first rounds? It wasn't that long agao at all! Anyways, Tony has A LOT of trading to do if he wants to have any competency at QB, WR, or TE and those two RBs are probably not going to be league winners this year. He's in for a potentially long season of rebuilding.<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/chitpoker.png"> 
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Tyler - Caught Him Drinking at Work (5.0)</b><br />
            Well Tyler has said he's been more hungover at the draft each year. Did he wake up and drink some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqqd5rin490">"juice"</a> too because they were out of Dr Pepper at the 7-11 before this draft? He had kept nobody so he had work to do, but picking St. Brown over Jeanty is going to haunt him for years, just sayin'. Bucky Irving's value comes from how much you can squeeze out of Tony, however Tony might actually say he's rebuilding again after he realized the last time he didn't trade away his whole draft that he won the entire thing. Hall and McConkey may have some potential to be difference makers but it's slim. I don't think Ty has the worst team here, but I also don't see him finishing above .500.<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/claws.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Travis - Pink Pony Club (5.5)</b
            ><br />
            Some may look at Travis's team and feel embarassed for him, but I think he's more than content with what it is and will wear it proudly. Two WRs that could finish in the Top 5 and Hurts at QB, which could be another Top 3-type season with all of the pushes of the tushes. Those three players will keep Trav in every game and he can go dancing at the Pink Pony Club (and then to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHIail0wJyQ">Subway right after</a>).<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/pony.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Greg - Do It Lady! (8.0)</b><br />
            My "draft sabotage" seems to have back-fired (not that it was a thing in the first place anyway), but Greg has one of the strongest teams after his very lackluster season last year. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miE07JBZO6Q">peacock may not be Rosie O'Donnell</a> but a combo of CMC, London, and McBride gives Greg significant advantages at all three skill positions assuming CMC still has gas left in the tank. Greg is not only the main competition in my division but in this whole league, so I expect to meet him in the Championship Game... do it lady!<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/doitlady.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Kevin - The Earthquake (4.5)</b><br />
            He kept Kyren Williams over Lamar Jackson. Do I need to say more? Now he's stuck with an ok WR and ok RB and... Drake Maye? A stable of Cleveland Brown RBs not name Quinshon Judkins? Absolute disaster, like what an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7ZFyIQR1xQ">Earthquake</a> leaves. But hey man, thanks for Lamar!<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/copier.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Tommy - He Almost Got Fired! (7.0)</b><br />
            Go back a couple of years ago and Tommy has an ELITE team with Jonathan Taylor, Mahomes, and Tyreek Hill, buuuuut it's not a couple of years ago. Times change. Now did Tommy draft some good talent at RB though in Brown and Hampton, sure. Will it propel him to the playoffs? Will his "old-timers" bounce back into elite form? Will Quinshon Judkins turn into a stud on a lackluster Browns team? Tommy, are you listening? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgRYibGXF-c">Are you just nodding your head yes to everything I say?</a> Well I think he'll be ok in the end as he has players with A LOT of potential, I'm just not sure if that potential will be reached in 2025 vs 2026.<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/fired.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Leary - He's Retiring (7.8)</b><br />
            We goin' back to the 90's- fantasy style! That means drafting QBs up high! Leary did a great job taking Jayden Daniels after I made the difficult choice to take Lamar instead right before. Just like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-qoWzHByGY">Spice Girl</a> that Chit dresses up as, Sean's team is <i>SCARY</i> His top players should be in the Top 5 positions, QB, RB, and WR. If LaPorta actually has a rebirth, he may have all FOUR skill positions on lock. The only reason for dinging this lineup though is because LaPorta stung him pretty bad last year and it may happen again.<img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/scary.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Seph - Bad News (5.5)</b><br />
            Seph was all geared up to fight for a title this year as he came out swinging with the #1 TE by a lot and potentially the #1 QB in Josh Allen. We we're entering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QM6-hwlhH8">the Lion's Den</a>! But then, I think he got distracted by some elf bowling. He's crossing his fingers that Marvin Harrison Jr will actually produce this year and be that key third piece to being a championship caliber team I guess. Everybody else on this roster is a snooze-fest. He'll have to hope Josh and Brock go nuclear or else we're looking at a .500 season here.<img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/bowlingelf.png">
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Cerca - Scalp Massager (8.1)</b><br />
            Just like using a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcnQImxXVaY">Scalp Massager</a> is the best preventative measure to going bald (according to Chit at least), drafting three potential Top 5's at RB, WR, and TE is a great way to prevent a losing season. Cerca has some young talent on here too that bodes well for future keepers, but it's his top picks of Nabers, Gibbs, and Kittle that are going to light up the scoreboard this year. Dak, if he can stay healthy, too is going to help with CeeDee breaking records as that Cowboy defense is in shambles.<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/scalp.png"> 
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Schteeeve - Truth or Dare (6.5)</b><br />
            I'm almost done with this and I'm realizing that I'm being pretty nice this year. I'd love to dish out some more sub 5.0 scores but I couldn't as Schteeeve did a solid job. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb62fd0Hd48">got the ball rolling</a> as his team has Chase, BTJ, and Cook. I'm assuming these will provide enough points to stay competitive each week. With some luck he can flip it into a winning season and who knows, maybe he'll be streaking at some point? Winning streaking that is.  <br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/truth.png">

          <li class="space">
            <b>SOB - Gym (10.0)</b
            ><br />
             This is just getting redicilous, every year I trade away my 4th and 5th rounders and think that my team will resember Chit here at the gym. But then, it resembels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LP3tiz17k5E">Chit at the Gym</a>.  Top QB in the game, Top WR in the game, possibly the top RB, if not Top 5 mininum in the game, and then the TE you all vastly overlooked. Ty Warren was a BEAST at Penn St and DOMINATED the college fantasy football league last year (you guys should really join that league next year, it's great)... and now I get him all the way down the draft board? I'm sorry but this year I might go undefeated and finally claim the 100% rule that been in effect for 20+ years (undefeated season wins 100% of the pot). Anyways, I've typed enough, I see football about to be coming on my screen so... "back to it".<br><img src="https://file.garden/aHv0Hbj9PThoD4eE/chitgym.png">

        Again, this is all for fun- don't take the criticisms or praise to heart, just screwing around... but I will win in the end ;)
