      <div class="titles">2022 Draft Recap</div>
      <div class="money">
        Yo, it's 2022! It's football season again too! First we gotta pour one out for a long time member Jeff, as he turned in his clipboard and handed the reigns over to our newest member Adam. Now that that's done it's time to continue the tradition like none other... THE 2022 NJCO DRAFT RECAP!!!<br><br>I'm going to continue the format of tying draft results to the current events of the year here for at least ONE more year (as I was too lazy to come up with some other fun way of doing this), so without further adieu...

            <b>Goldust - Winter Olympics</b><br />
            It happened, will anybody remember it though? Maybe? Montgomery and Dobbins don't feel like slam dunk picks at all, but then there's solid ones like Sutton, Brady, and Stevenson. I've just heard all of those twitter folk/youtubers drewl over Stevenson as the biggest get of 2022... I've been burned too many times by Patriot RBs so I am done taking chances on them but hey, it may pan out? His roster is like that Ski Jump next to the old power plant - it could be impressive but looks... weird?<br><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/48LwqtDkT8uvdyYnj9ToFBLJKKk=/0x0:5272x3514/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5272x3514):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23224722/usa_today_17632467.jpg" height="178" width="300">

            <b>Uncle Dad - Ukraine Invasion</b><br />
            I'm just scratching my head on this one. What should've been basically a "walk-in-the-park" for the desired outcome (a solid draft in Sean's case) turned into an unforseen struggle. He doesn't keep Barkley only to... draft Barkley with his first pick? I don't see the Giants scoring a ton of points this year so I guess he's praying for high-volume. Then he reaches for an often injured TE, a split-time RB in a muddied Buffalo backfield, a top WR... in Chicago where WRs go to die, then Drake London?? James Robinson?? And Garrett Wilson?? At least Wilson is a potential elite-WR but he's on an awful offense. It seems like Mr Leary just wanted to draft players in the state of NY/NJ. Very odd, should've had his division on lock this year.

            <b>Uno Moss RBBC por favor - Inflation</b><br />
            I mean it's there, we all can't avoid it, but I don't think any of us like it. His keepers were good but then right outta the gate we see... Breece Hall?!? Cam Akers is a huge question mark, then back-to-back TE's?? Seriously, back-to-back TE's... and it's not Kelce + Andrews where one is trade bait and suffocating the position, it was Conklin and Knox. He went from RBBC to TEBC I guess. Conklin had a whopping TWO games of double-digit points last year, so are we missing something? Probably could have drafted him in the last round if you really wanted him, just sayin'

            <b>I Touchdown There - Housing Bubble</b
            ><br />
            This year we saw the housing market peak at absolute insanity with crazy overbids, however those overbids weren't as big as Tyler's when it came to the draft. Up and down his draft he drafted players multiple rounds ahead of where he could have gotten them easily. Trey Lance at 91st overall, Zamir White who's projected to have 45 pts ALL SEASON at 115th,  and Brian "I literally just got shot" Robinson at 126th!

            <b>Jake's Warriors - Monkey Pox</b><br />
            Something happened but nobody was really paying attention to it. It was like "hey, over here, I can be important too" but then they just let the computer autodraft like 1,000 RBs on their team. Who knows what will be the outcome... I can't even give a grade here because it's the computer who stole Irv Smith with the 190th pick in the draft.

            <b>Motorboating SOB's - World Juniors Ending</b><br />
            Crazy, unexpected, what the?? No way! That was said when <a href="https://twitter.com/animalsofhockey/status/1561184273612378113?s=20&t=wtuyLywBX2AQI6yVDvuxQQ" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanTyrer/status/1561183723202252800?s=20&t=wtuyLywBX2AQI6yVDvuxQQ"  target="_blank">this</a> happened at the WJ Gold Medal game this summer. Incredible save out of nowhere as Adam seems to have taken over Jeff's team and immediately buffed it up and made it looking like the class of the Hayduk division. Not much else to say but just solid and consistent team. With a couple of trades during the season he could be the team to beat.

            <b>CHIP'S PORNO PASSWORD - Flightline's Pacific Classic</b><br />
            For those of you who don't follow horse racing, we just saw possibly the greatest show of force on a racetrack since the great Secretariat this weekend. What we saw out of Tom in this draft well, "take a good luck at this because you're not going to see this too often, maybe never again". Tom killed it in this draft, yes he had a ton of high picks that helped, but he made the best value of just about all of those picks. His team is scary with a lot of depth too. It's going to be hard to top him in the standings but a solid 2nd-place finish in the Rispoli is extremely likely.<br />

          <li class="space">
            <b>WheelsOnTheBusGoRoundNRound - Las Vegas Rain Saga</b><br />
            I don't know what is going on- his roster, much like Las Vegas's infrastructure looked strong, glitzy, and impressive... but now is in shambles. What once was a deep resevoir of mammouth proportions turned into <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobsVegasLife/status/1566204438099869696?s=20&t=wtuyLywBX2AQI6yVDvuxQQ" target="_blank">this</a>. And then an uber-impressive sportsbook at Circa turned into <a href="https://twitter.com/SBRSportsPicks/status/1553025301126455297?s=20&t=wtuyLywBX2AQI6yVDvuxQQ" target="_blank">this crazy scene</a>. And here we have Tony's roster... a bunch of handcuffs he's reaaaally hoping that will benefit from an early season injury. Or, like in most cases, and like in Vegas properties, he'll just mortgage off next season's picks (repairs for Vegas) and try to keep the lights on for yet another miracle season. We shall see.

            <b>Kupp Check - The James Webb Space Telescope</b><br />
            Click this video for the line I will be referencing (and also it's just a classic video we should all be quoted every day)<br />
            <iframe width="300" height="168.75" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8n2cIeIpzLA?start=43" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />Ho-ly Shit Jay- Tommy has some damn good eyesight, he's the James Webb Space Telescope of fantasy football of the past few years, spotting talent that "we ain't never seen before", and turning it into championships. Just like the telescope has opened us to new galaxies and such, this year looks no different with picks like Etienne, Hurts, Bateman, and possibly Pacheco. Not saying they will all be tier 1 at their positions but some will be incredible values that lead him to the playoffs yet again while we're all just saying "what the fuck is that bro?".

            <b>Back in Black - Mafia Actor Deaths</b><br />
            This year we lost both famous actors that played major roles in the biggest Mafia movies of all-time in Ray Liotta and James Caan. Yes, they played their asses off and nobody can take away the performances they had. But their days are over now and we have to accept it, just like all of us in this league have accepted the elite fantasy days of Kelce, Evans, Aaron Jones, Jacobs, and Scary Terry are over and we move on... except Travis. Poor guy had a ton of high picks and yet his team looks like it'll fall down to the bottom of the standings yet again and die a slow death like Sonny at the toll booth. (I mean he was shot like 100 times in the car and he still got out, stood up, and then fell to the ground... maybe that'll be Back in Black's season, a brief glimpse of something but then nope, nope).

            <b>Team Crawford - Top Gun Maverick</b><br />
            A classic blockbuster went on a bit of a hiatus only to come roaring back with a vegence! Damn Greg, just... damn. He's got 3 RB that legit could finished 1,2,3 at the end of the year, solid QBs, ok WRs and didn't reach for a TE. He's looking to get yet another plaque up on the <a href="https://njco-halloffame.glitch.me/" target="_blank">NJCO Hall of Fame</a><br>

            <b>Preferred Customers - FBI Raid of Mar-a-lago</b
            ><br />
             So there was some top-secret stuff that apparently none of you knew about... until NOW! Look what got uncovered... Deluxe RB machine (Fournette), Big Screen TE (Andrews), and a THX-quality roster that'll make George Lucas cream in his pants! I should be under arrest for possession of some hot material if you know what I mean... my roster, their stats they will be putting up is what's hot if you needed the hint. You all slept on all of the potential next Justin Jefferson and Jamar Chase's. Sure some may not pan out, but I have like 50 of them, so a couple will and the three-headed QB machine along with my other top picks will carry this team to glory! <br /><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/6scj9p.jpg" height="175" width="300">
