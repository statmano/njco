      <div class="money">
        Yo, it's 2024 and we just completed our 20-something draft for the NJCO fantasy football league! We have not one, but TWO new members this year so I guess I'll do a quick recap of what this is. It started <i>before</i> Yahoo started generating their trash recaps that are wildly off, but then once those started I really have had fun with it putting to shame their false predicitions and grades with the God's Honest Truth about which teams drafted well, which missed their shots, and then which should have just gone on autodraft from the start. So without further adieu- IT'S THE 2024 DRAFT RECAP (Paris Olympics Style!)

            <b>Tyler - The Opening Ceremony Threeway</b><br />
            We're going to start off with just... confusion. We had heads in toilets, head scratching, "wait why are they doing- are they really going to, ohhhh ok"s, and such throughout Tyler's draft. I mean his picks turned out alright despite all of this, and like the throuple, maybe he'll be enjoying himself as the games start.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/openceremony.jpeg?v=1725295777890">

            <b>Cerca - USA Womens Rugby Last Second Win</b><br />
            So looking over Cerca's picks they actually weren't that bad... they weren't great, but weren't bad. He LOVED the unproven WRs (London, Nabers, McConkey, even XLG late) so there's definite risk involved with his lineup. However he pulled out some late pick potential miracles going with a defensive strategy with Dallas (defenses DO score in this league) and some other strong sleeper material. So maybe, just maybe, he pulls out the Bronze medal just like the Rugby team did.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%203.59.35%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725307186995">

            <b>Tommy - Casual Turkish Shooter</b><br />
            Tommy's track record kind of speaks for itself in this league with SIX Championship Game appearances (and three titles), so I'm done trying to say anything bad about is drafts. Kelce in the first though is ehhh, Davante Adams on a terrible Vegas team is ehhh, down to Justin Herbert burning up a bench spot without any WRs to throw to... ok so Tommy made SIX Championship games... but he also only won THREE of them... the silver medal, which this may be... just like the Turkish Shooter guy.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%205.13.27%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725311616536">

            <b>Sean Leary - The Beautiful Venues</b
            ><br />
            Yooo France did an awesome job with the venues they had at the Olympics this year. From Beach Volleyball right in front of the Eiffel Tower, to the horseback riding at Versailles, and then fencing and such inside Mueusems- they were a sight to behold. A sight to behold just like Sean's team this year- solid production up and down his lineup. Has Hurts but he might actually end up starting his LAST PICK in Watson half the time! Who else can say that- in a good way too! Even snagged the #1 projected defense along the way. Bravo Mr. Leary, I'm kind of regretting picking you in my division now.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%205.29.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725312610009">

            <b>Tony - Australian Breakdancer</b><br />
            I guess I have to transition from the best to the worst. For the first time in YEARS Tony actually had draft picks ahead of round 13! You'd think he'd be razor sharp on getting some great players, but all those years off must have left him rusty. He looked lost, even Yahoo has him projected to finish 4-10! I mean it gets that way when you draft like it's 2019 instead of 2024. In a league that's been dominated by WR heavy teams in recent years, Tony decides "nah, FOUR straight RBs to start my draft". Goes up and grabs the JETS defense at 107? Then, like the breakdancer, we all thought maybe, just maybe they could redeem themselves with something really good at the end... but no, Tony drafts some dude out of <s>Alabama</s> no wait <s>Michigan</s> no wait New Hampshire??? At least he's playing for a solid plug-n-play offense... wait, he's on the Raiders? Wow... just wow.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%205.57.47%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725314277669">

            <b>Schteve - Leon Marchand</b><br />
            "Whoa whoa whoa Sean- comparing Schteve's draft to one of the top athletes in all of the Olympics?? Trying to suck up to the new guy to fleece him later or something huh?"- that answer is plainly no. This is more along the lines of being handed a terrible draft option from a guy named "Leon" and then just trying to be good at ONE THING (swimming is really just one event chopped into 58 different things), and that one thing was drafting "okay" RBs. Guy seriously took not one, not two, not three, but keep going... SEVEN of them. That's impressive I must say. How that'll turn out is anybody's guess as they get hurt constantly in the NFL, but otherwise I just don't see him going very far with Brock Purdy at QB- his backup, Rodgers, I'd probably take before him.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%206.15.53%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725315368653">

            <b>Travis - Quincy Hall's Strained 400m</b><br />
            Travis went out and did what you should do- give it all your best and grab as many top WRs as you can, then sprinkle in an elite QB and boom, you are looking at a lot of W's in front of you. Just like Quincy Hall coming around the final turn, a lot of us had doubts if Travis would ever return to the playoffs after apparently selling his soul for <i>finally</i>an appearance two years ago. I even gave him high praise last year before JJ's injury derailed his season. But he seems to be straining and giving it his "Hall" by the results of this years draft. My only question is if he knows how little rookie WRs tend to produce their first year (they aren't all JJ's and Nacua's).<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%208.10.25%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725322235595">

            <b>Jack - Snoop Dogg</b><br />
            Jack is riding high- not like "high in the standings" but just "high and enjoying life". You kind of need to be that way when you draft the way he did. His whole team is kind of banking on Cooper Kupp to return to a once-in-a-lifetime season, which I don't particuallary think will happen, but I could be wrong. The rest of his roster is a bunch of middle-tier-at-best players and Jordan Love was taken wayyy to high for my Bears fan taste. Also, Taysom Hill as your TE means like two weeks of 16 pts and 11 other nothing-burgers, but so be it.<img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%208.13.47%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725323716126">

          <li class="space">
            <b>Greg - Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles</b><br />
            Greg, like Tommy, has the track record to outshine anything negative I can say here... but that's not going to stop me from doing so anyway. His team, like Greg Focker's stock portfolio, is "strong, to quite strong", no doubt. However he's got a little bit of weakness at QB (I'm not sold on Richardson), a little bit of an aging keeper in CMC with an injury risk, and his WRs tend to be number... twos (insert Dr. Evil meme here). So like Biles and Chiles, he has <b>serious</b> potential to do some <b>big</b> damage, but may wind up faltering and missing out on the gold in the end (or missing out completely after a last second stat correction by Yahoo).<img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%208.59.10%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725325675042">

            <b>Kevin - Anna Hall's Heptathlon</b><br />
            The new kid is coming in fresh off of winning our Dyansty Hockey league and is looking to continue success on for the next generation. However his draft, much like Anna Hall's heptathlon, came up a bit disappointing. Keeping Kyren Williams to start was risky and looks, as of right now, as an awful choice. Grabbing Nico Collins as high as he did makes me think he knows something we all don't- not saying Collins won't be good, but you want something a little more sured of being great at that position. However Tony bailed him out with head-scratchers before his next pick came- so he went with... Mike Evans? Hmm. Kevin's whole draft is littered with guys who were more relevant a couple of years ago than this upcoming season. His whole draft feels like Anna Hall's javelin throw- he thought it was really good but in the end won't amount to much at all.<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%209.16.38%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725326650279">

            <b>Seph - Noah Lyles and his COVID</b><br />
            We have another 7-RB drafter in Seph as he actually went FIVE STRAIGHT PICKS taking RBs at one point. Guys, it's 2024 not 2006- RBs are incredibly risky and phased out by RBBCs... why are we still treating them like the Ladanian Tomlinson days? Anyways, Seph's quality in this draft was very much like the 100m dash... great and over fast. His Top 3 picks were spot on and should keep him in a lot of games. After that though he slowed down like Lyles did when he got COVID. Why anybody would draft a Raider is a mystery as they might be the worst offense of all-time. To name your team after one of the players, ok, you do you. Bowers isn't going up against tiny college LBs each week now on a stacked Georgia team. Lyles still got bronze though in the 200m though so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%209.25.59%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725327387647">

            <b>SOB - Steph Curry and Team USA</b
            ><br />
             What can I say, just like Steph, this guy can't miss! Nailed every pick despite having two huge gaps to wait through. Two <b>ELITE</b> keeper WRs, the #1 QB, his #1 WR (now that Kelce is breaking down), and <b>EIGHT</b> total WRs- which should have been nine but I really think Juwan Johnson is basically a WR playing TE so. You all also let Jayden Daniels slip ALL THE WAY to pick 150?!? Insane and I'm glad to roster him just to block all of you from probably top 5 QB numbers by year's end. And the Bears defense, c'mon guys! I was going to write this season off- just had the greatest season ever last year and had a drooling baby distracting me throughout this thing, but I guess not- keep on keepin' on I guess. You shouldn't have woken the Sleeping Babies... now don't let them get hot!<br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/67c5c6ce-8583-4a63-b3f1-93e491e36ed3/Screenshot%202024-09-02%20at%2010.00.22%E2%80%AFPM.png?v=1725328839939">
