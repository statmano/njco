      <div class="money">
        Hmm, 2020, perfectly normal year... it's time for a perfectly normal
        draft recap. OR LET'S BLOW THE LID OFF OF THIS THING AND GO CRAZY!<br /><br />This
        year I'm going to switch it up a bit and theme it up a bit too. So let's
        get movin' on it- here is SOB's 2020 Draft Analysis!
        <ul>
          <li class="space">
            <b>Peppers New Shorts - Wuhan China</b><br />
            Let's start where it all started, the guy with the first pick. He
            had first crack and then dominated the news for the first couple
            rounds after that with his team basically being filled up before
            some teams even had a chance to add to their rosters, you'd expect a
            dynamite team then right? Ehhh, it's ok. Russell Wilson is solid,
            but not dominant. Same goes with his RBs in Chubb, Ekeler, Bell, and
            Gordon... and Singletary... and Howard... and Jesus Christ you have
            a case of like 83,000 RBs on your team! In the end, servicable,
            won't be dominating anybody though- probably in the clear when the
            whole thing wraps up though to where his team can throw some pool
            parties without worry.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>I Touchdown There - Murder Hornets</b><br />
            Blam! Tyler burst into this years draft with a ton of picks he had
            to make the news! Outside of keeping Lamar though he's very... kind
            of a non-story? You'd think with that scary of a situation we'd all
            be in deep fear of his team this year, but they actually look very
            beatable. Sure he'll win some games but with all of the picks he
            had, those victories may only be by 5 or so points instead of
            shredding off 30-40 point blowouts.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>GatoRat - The Remote Worker</b><br />
            Just thumbing through his lineup and it seems like every one of his
            RBs will see some time on the field, but will be "home on the
            sidelines" for a good chunk with quite a lot of timeshare stuff
            going on. He's got some WR's that can really Zoom though (Thank you
            thank you, I'll be here all weekend, try the veal). In the end he'll
            either need to make some moves to add an RB that plays 20+ snaps or
            really hope his WRs play on teams that need to pass quite often.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Back in Black - All those DNC candidates that disappeared</b
            ><br />
            I mean you just look through his roster and outside of his keepers
            he's got nobody that can be a #1 option on their team. JuJu isn't #1
            WR talent, he needs an AB to take the best coverage off of him.
            Mostert is explosive, great in the playoffs, but why hasn't he shown
            us he can do a full season of work? Why do NFL teams keep giving up
            on Brandon Cooks? Dude used to be lights out, now he's been
            complimentary player at best. Not going to be a great season for
            Back in Black... but due to Mahomes' god-like stats, we'll still
            know his name if mentioned.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Jakes Warriors - Tik Tok Kid</b><br />
            Wow man, how young can a team be? You drafted like 50 rookies and
            then some old guy who wants to be part of it. Check the video below
            from our man who played Taco on the league. Theilen's really good
            but he won't get the volume, Jacobs is still on a bad team, and
            unless their name is Randy Moss, rookies never carry a fantasy
            team.<br /><iframe

            <b>Air Force Ones - The Stock Market</b><br />
            I can't say anything but great things about Jeff's draft. He had a
            down period last year, thought maybe it would last pretty long too
            as he didn't have many good keeper options, but then ta-dow! Dude
            roared back in no time! Has top talent at every position, including
            TE where games are won and lost often. Although this is before we've
            played a single week, is his team just an illusion, or are things
            doomed to come crashing down?
          </li>

            <b>Tank for 2021 - Wild Fires</b><br />
            Well from the highs of this years draft, to the absolute lows. His
            draft didn't get started until real late but man it's been a
            blazing, hellish, craptastic event since it did. Ok that's a little
            harsh, especially when your first pick comes at pick #99 (outside of
            the keeper rounds). I guess his strategy was to just go heavy, and I
            mean HEAVY on handcuff RBs as I don't think he'll be even able to
            start a full roster of guys who actually play (even with an 8-person
            bench)! Also he made the mistake of drafting Baker Mayfield... the
            guy who couldn't even outrun some old, fat cops - this video never
            gets old. Just like Baker said in that video, Tony is already saying
            with his team name "Are you kidding me? I'm done!" <br /><iframe

            <b>Goldust - Online Comedy</b><br />
            You know when you're forced into trying something out because of the
            situation, but it just doesn't work? Jack tried out some of the new
            material with drafting some young guys, but tended to stick to some
            old reliables- Hilton, Edelman, DJAX... The old reliables will
            probably score the points for him, but that's the problem... he just
            lacks the fire power to light up the scoreboard. I've got a sinking
            feeling that Kyler Murray's small frame too won't be able to "take a
            joke" and he'll wind up on the injury report, leaving this team with
            a terrible QB situation. "Take a joke", get it? No? See this comedy
            stuff sometimes just doesn't play on the internet- ugh!
          </li>

            <b>Leary's Team - The Protests</b><br />
            Oh whaaaat, the commish is going to bring in BLM stuff into this???
            Is he getting all political, is this going to be some big stance? Oh
            shit, I don't look at facebook because of this stuff... here we go.
            Well no, I'm not going to get all political in a fantasy football
            league, that stuff has it's own time and places- I just looked at
            Leary's team here and it was the first analogy that came up. His
            team is deep and looks like it can sustain itself for some time too.
            Relentless... and on the right night, can really fuck some shit up
            too if you're on the receiving end.

            <b>Kupp Check - Bubble Sports Leagues</b><br />
            His draft went off without a hitch. Effective, to the point, and
            looks like it's getting the job done. Should be a good battle at the
            top of the "To Be Named" division.

            ><br />
            Putting that pussy on the chainwax! This team was collecting
            valueable players like MC Mom was collecting rooms in the house.
            Word up! With the combo of Jones, Lindsay, and Montgomery this team
            has that running man down. Getting a win vs this team will be harder
            than opening a magazine with soda spilled on it. So yea he didn't
            have a pick until #63 but he started it, he's going to finish it.
            And by finish it we're talking Championship. This team can feel it's
            skilllz growin', it's gonna be the baddest bitch in the biz taking
            it's show on the road. You can all clean your own- well rosters up,
            because they don't compare. Peace! Wait, where were the metaphors to
            Some Good News? Oh sorry I just wanted to make references to that
            Key and Peele skit- much funnier ;)

        Take that to the bank and cash it folks! (barring any roster moves, in
        which Tony will have only 2 original players on his team by the end of
        the year so who really knows what going to happen in those first two
        playoff rounds loser-wise :) - Feel like this should be the disclaimer
        every year.<br /><br />But oh, in the end, this is all in fun and games.
        Best of luck to all of you, thanks for participating for a 21st year???
        Damn... that's a long time. But yes, see one of you in the championship!
