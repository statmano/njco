      <div class="titles">2023 Draft Recap</div>
      <div class="money">
        Hey guys, it's 2023, we just completed the draft, and yahoo's grades are stillll crap. So we're bringing back the true draft recap, but this year I'm switching things up. Instead of using metaphors to the events of the year, we're going to view the draft through the lens of the internets favorite show- "Hot Ones". So each team will be compared to a level of hot sauces that are experienced during that show- basically how are YOU going to feel when YOU play each team that was just drafted?
        <ul>
          <li class="space">
            <b>Lawrence and the Machines - Classic Hot Sauce (1,600 Scovilles)</b><br />
            Ahh, the old go to- nothing crazy, good flavor, an overall pleasant experience. Tyreek Hill and Davante Adams may sting you a little here and there but the rest of the roster is pretty tepid. He'll win some games and Trevor Lawrence may finish as a Top 6 QB, but this is nothing to be that fearful of.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Jake's Warriors - Curry Verde (6,000 Scovilles)</b><br />
            Ok Travis Kelce alone is going to bring a bit of pain and probably dig you into an early hole, however Cerca's roster really doesn't pack much of a punch after that. This is despite having three picks in the first two rounds! I don't have a ton of faith that a rookie RB will be racking up a 2nd round pick's worth of points and then his reach for Isiah Pacheco was more of a head scratcher than a mouth burner. I do love Deuce Vaughn as a player, and his time <i>will</i> come, it just most likely won't be this year as he gets acquainted to being literrally have the size of every other player on the field. 
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Motorboating SOBs - Lemon Pepper (15,500 Scovilles)</b><br />
            We're still in the "no sweating/I could handle multiple of these" phase. Adam's top four picks are pretty solid, his 5th and 6th are ok role players... then things fall off into obscurity. Middle-of-the-road teams will win when their stars pop off, elite teams will have 90% of their starting lineup pop-off and Adam's, in it's drafted state, doesn't possess that threat. You'll notice though, that he's above two of his conference rivals, so I still do expect a possible winning record by the end of the year, mainly on the backs of his top four picks.

            <b>RAINBOW RANDOLPH'S ROCKET SHIPS - Chile Lengua De Fuego (36,500 Scovilles)</b
            ><br />
            This is where stuff starts to get hot and you gotta sweat things out a bit. Tom has decent depth and some youngsters that have some high ceiling potentials. He went heavy on the Jets- part of that feels like a big mistake, but I'm a Bears fan and I've been burned by Aaron Rodgers enough times to know to not underestimate the damage he can do. But two Jets RBs?? Well, the Packers had the Jones/Williams combo and there was plenty to go around. However, that lack of diversification can really bite him in the ass when the Jets have a bad game- teams done and doesn't stand a chance, while other teams can weather the storm. Tom's probably my biggest competition in the Rispoli- but I'll get by him and move on.

            <b>I Touchdown There - Ice Water (0 Scovilles)</b><br />
            We all need a break from the heat and a bit of refreshing to recenter ourselves- that's Tyler's team. Kupp's injuries are scary, he's definitely missing a chunk of time and when he gets back he probably won't be close to what he was two years ago. He was a keeper. AJ Brown is nice, but Philly has a lot of mouths to feed- he'll see some BIG games but also some forgetful statlines as well. He's riding Daniel Jones and Daniel Jones <b>ONLY</b> at QB?? TE is a whiff too... I can't see him winning much this year unless something drastic happens. His whole roster seems to be second-fiddle at best. It'll be a nice relief when he appears on the schedule.

          <li class="space">
            <b>Goldust - Los Calientes (49,000 Scovilles)</b><br />
            So on the show (at least the episode that I used as a reference for the hot sauce names, Gal Gadot's), the 5th sauce is the "step down" sauce. It's technically hotter than the previous one, but due to flavors involved it feels like a step down. This sums up Jack's team pretty well. He's got some BIG names on this roster at every position, it looks scary. However, that was A LOT of stock put into Bijan Robinson for the 1st pick in the draft. He passed up on proven talent, absolute difference makers like Kelce, for a rookie... playing for an offense that may have zero threat in the passing game. I had to dock him points for that. Derrick Henry is getting up there in age and mileage and RBs fall off a cliff right around the point he is at. DeVonta Smith is incredible, but in an offense where TDs may be stolen by others around the goal line. He drafted two TEs... why?? He drafted two Defenses... they aren't even elite defenses... why?? Jack's team could have been the hottest of them all, but he made some potentially critical errors that may burn him, not us, as the season plays out.

            <b>Back in Black - Spicy Shark (71,000 Scovilles)</b><br />
            Mr. D+ himself finally appears on my draft recap! And it's not in a terrible spot! Gal Gadot said this sauce was "evil", it snuck up on her and she started putting napkins under her armpits?? Travis's roster is pretty evil- We know that Jefferson can burn us alone- but sneaky good pick with Cooper. DeShaun Watson is still a REALLY GOOD quarterback and Cooper is going to be the beneficiary of quite a lot of yards and TDs being his #1 option. He had Burrow but also nabbed Russell Wilson in a sneaky ass 154th pick that pissed me off (I wanted him as a backup or trade bait when Sean Payton gets him rolling). Travis did a pretty good job at maximizing each pick- the only part that sucks is that he traded away a first rounder so he just lacks that other heavyweight game changer that would put him over the top. Those first two rounds are so crucial. In any case, quite a few of us will be throwing our hands up in the air and wondering "what the hell just happened" after we encounter this team.

            <b>The Patriot Way - Adoboloco (103,000 Scovilles)</b><br />
            Seans in this league spitting straight fiyah! Leary had kept the "Jersey connection" in Saquon and Wilson and those two serve as a nice foundation of weekly points. He then really had a nice finger on the pulse of using that 6-player bench to get potential gamebreakers who are "next men up" instead of "ho-hum, meh" fill-ins. He's one of the only ones who did this... effectively. If things bounce his way even a little, he should have that Hayduk title once again. But also, why two TE's and two DEFs??? What is this trend?!?
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>The Sandy Hookers - Da Bomb (135,600 Scovilles)</b><br />
            Wait, wait, wait- I didn't put myself at the very end- in the spot where I am the best drafter by far and you have to make a face, struggle through my egregious self-promotion, possibly vomit until you can finally see the playoff predictions? Well, if you follow the Hot Ones Show, "Da Bomb" IS the kick-you-in-the-ass, fuck-you-up, "I-don't-want-to-play-anymore-because-this-is-too-much" sauce! My draft rocked, flat out. Almost every single player I wanted I got. I'm loaded at QB with Josh Allen, I have 10, yes 10 WRs that I can rely on. I was stil able to get two really good RBs. And even though I swore off putting TE as a priority after the Mark Andrews DEBACLE last year- I still wound up with one that will probably finish Top 4 at WORST. If Derrick Henry breaks down too- got that ish covered. It's over boys... just give me the prize money now.

          <li class="space">
            <b>Marty Mush - Glass of Milk (-2,000 Scovilles)</b><br />
            I like to purposively exagerrate how bad Tony drafts. He always seems to stick himself with very few high draft picks at all and I understand it can be hard to assemble much of anything good with that- but it's fun to make it seem worse than it actually is. This year, I don't even need to exagerrate. This roster is pathetic. I mean we all knew it was going to be bad when he not only announced his two keepers, but then when others pointed out that it may not be the wisest to keep those two, he doubled-down on the "young RB theory" he had--- then only to ask for a redo on his keeper announcement after the fact when he realized what he did! That comedy aside- he then proceeded to draft 3rd string after 3rd string RB to the count of TEN running backs on his roster. There were some good highlights like drafting Evan Hull (from that dynamite 1-11 Northwestern team last year) while the guy who is actually starting for the Colts, Deon Jackson- didn't even get drafted at all. As we all know, Tony is a big hockey fan- Rangers in particular... that same franchise that signed Eric Lindros after multiple massive concussions only to see him get yet another one shortly after and basically end his career. Well, Tony's QB stock is SOLELY in Tua (insert bad concussion joke here). Saying all of this though, and Tony's penchant for mortgaging off next year's picks to remain relevant yet again... maybe some weird injury happens or Cordarelle Patterson somehow gets his EIGTH wind and we are all left with sour stomachs as this Glass of Milk, was actually spoiled.

            <b>Team Crawford - Hopp Sauce Watermelon Ghost (641,000 Scovilles)</b><br />
            It's just not fair that our current reigning champion didn't even have to trade away much of any of his draft picks to get the title last year and could keep the likes of CMac and Chubb. I would love to not have to write glowing things yet again about Greg's team but it's hard to find much of any weakness on this lineup. Two TE's? Yea, fuck that- why do we keep drafting two TE's... can't have the hottest scoville count with two TE's. Aww shit, Tommy C drafted two TE's too?!? Ughh... ok, ummm.. Greg wasted a valuable pick on Anthony Richardson- the guy isn't very good, I watched him in college- dude failed to complete double-digit passes THREE TIMES last year! In any case, he'll drop him after reading that- his team is still going to suck to play. He has a good chance at winding up as the back wall portrait in the <a href="https://njco-halloffame.glitch.me/" target="_blank">NJCO Hall of Fame</a><br>

            <b>Kupp Check - Apollo (TBA Scovilles)</b
            ><br />
             Is this one the hottest? Is it actually an ok ending? It seems like it still sucks to experience and they do put it last... so yeah, Tommy had the best draft that wasn't mine. He had a shit ton of early picks so it made it really hard to mess up. I was between Lamb and Diggs for my first pick, I hope I made the right choice. I know that Mark Andrews is going to blow up yet again after I decided not to ever want him on my team again. He even got Kamara at 71st... I know he's suspended but 71st?? People! A stable full of bell-cow RBs, Scary Terry who may finally have a QB that can throw him good passes, and if Jonathan Taylor gets picked up- fuck that roster can be loaded the second half of the season! Tip of the cap to this draft is all I can say... and glad this is over!
