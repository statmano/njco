      <div class="titles">2021 Draft Recap</div>
      <div class="money">
        So here we are, 2021, we made it (except for a few of us who were lepers...'Good one Beth!'). Ok osbcure Wet Hot American Summer references aside, we did somehow get back to what should be, a hopefully "normal" season? It was also the first year we had ZERO offseason votes! Yay!!! This league is running pretty well and it's time to continue the tradition like none other... THE 2021 NJCO DRAFT RECAP!!!<br><br>Last year's recap was pretty fun to write so I wanted to give it another run, so here it is, each team recapped in the style of the major events of 2021.
        <ul>
          <li class="space">
            <b>Jakes Warriors - SpaceX/Billionaires in Space</b><br />
            Ok, cool, decent job assembling something. I can't say it's fully not impressive, however- it's really not. I mean, we've seen this before, like a ton of times, for years. "Oh wow, you're in space, cool- but like what else you going to do now?" is just like "Oh Cerca assembled a decent team again, somehow with Cowboys squeezed into it... again, but like ok, now what- just going to never finish in the money?".
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>I Touchdown There - Pacific NW Heat Wave</b><br />
            Tyler's got some fire that he drafted - and it's going to burn bright for a few weeks this year. But it looks like his team is going to do what it tends to do and cool off by the end of the year. His draft was very similar, just like when the Northern parts of Canada got into triple digits, rounds 1-8 were cookin' for him, but then things returned back to normal and he started drafting washed up WRs and a prayer in Zach Ertz despite having Darren Waller already kept.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>tanking for 2022 now - The Evergiven Suez Canal Debacle</b><br />
            This team is stuck in the mud/sand and going to be messing up everything for a few months trying to right the ship. With the absolute lack of talent he was able to get because he traded away all of his picks for a lousy 4th place finish hug, we all know he's going to be scouring the waiver wire and making terrible offers yet again, just hoping he has some reason to watch football come week 4 after an 0-3 start to the season. He's going to need injuries to star RBs to have any chance of productive weeks from his stable of 2nd+3rd stringers at the position, and Tony- just like the Evergiven, nobody's going to get seriously physically hurt. But maybe we're all fooled and he'll actually just live up to his name and put very little effort into much outside of the trade deadline- I mean the guy can't even put in the effort to capitalize his team's name.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Back in Black - Oympics/Simone Biles</b
            ><br />
            I feel weird writing this one because Travis didn't even draft his own team. He got a case of the twisty's and somebody had to fill in for him. I mean similar to the silver medal team performance that resulted, the draft wasn't <i>that</i> bad, maybe when he returns to manage his team he finishes with a bronze as well? Possibly steal of the draft with Terrace Marshall at 176th.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>X-Ray Guy - Afghanistan</b><br />
            Ugh, just a disaster anyway you look at it... big lose/lose situation. Saquon off of an injury and a disgruntled QB as keepers... that's an iffy start. Then AJ "going to be fighting with Julio Jones for looks from an ehh QB" Brown... then CEH who had every opp to be dynamite last year and was ehhh... then not much after that. Ehhh.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Air Force Ones - Hurricane Ida</b><br />
            Jeff's draft was pretty solid and his roster is going to pack a punch. Some of us may underestimate it with hidden gems like Laviska Shenault and a late-round steal of DeVante Parker to go with the eye of his storm he drafted earlier, and we'll be underwater for a bit. However, does this roster have staying power (I'm staring directly at you Kyler Murray!)??
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>GatoRat - Mars Landing</b><br />
            It's an okay team, nothing crazy though. Just like getting something landing on Mars took a whole committee of people, every one of Seph's RBs seem to be mired in a RBBC situation at best. But like SpaceX and stuff, this has all been done before- it's nothing to write home about, like this roster. It's got potential to be a game-changer, but I'll pass on it for now.<br />
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Goldust - Vaccines</b><br />
            Is Najee Harris here to save the day!?! His first pick is an unproven rookie with only about a year and a half of development prior (in college). But, dude can ball- and is in a great situation in Pittsburgh to be given a nice shot to that offense that struggled a bit last year. He got some proven commodities after that as well, strong team- will he need a little booster come November... maybe, but also, maybe not?
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Kupp Check - The Delta Variant</b><br />
            Well I guess I gotta follow up vaccine talk with the Delta Variant right? Tommy finished his draft early- it shows, he's pretty stacked, not going to lie. He's coming with full force and he can possibly breakthrough some other teams in his division and secure a playoff spot... buuuut he also drated Jonathan Taylor first, which I questioned... maybe the the teams in his division will do just fine holding him at bay in the end.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Team Crawford - C Diff Infections</b><br />
            Just keeping the sickness/disease theme going to finish out that division. "But wait, Sean, there wasn't a major news story about C Diff?". Oh I know, but it was my personal #1 story as I had to battle that stupid fucking thing for almost five full months. Greg's team, like it, can just wipe out everybody every other week too! CMC and Cook as keepers- still puzzled how that happened but tip of the cap to him. A glint of hope is out there though as Carolina has Sam Darnold starting now... so maybe CMC, coming off an injury, actually isn't an all-world stat king? The rest of his team is ok- but those two keepers is kind of all that matters though isn't it?
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Peppers New Shorts - Stonks!</b><br />
            The autodrafter had his team assembled by the forces of the internet- and it's pumped up pretty nicely. However, it appears to be a false valuation that may collapse in just a short period of time... or maybe it's solid enough to linger around and have mini-good weeks here and there?<br>

            <b>The Dangerous Nights - Jan 6th</b
            ><br />
             Jan 6th was chaos- highly political too- this is a football league, let's have something more fun to talk about- the best sketch of 2021, that's news worthy. My team missed the playoffs last year- it used to be a piece of shit... but teams can change. I worked really really hard to change- got some great players now. From the proven vets like Woods and Robinson to electric rookies like DeVonta Smith and Elijah Moore... when you play my team, it's a Dangerous Night. So let's throw on the white bathing suits, slick back our hair, and live for collecting the 1st place money on New Year's Eve. Let's Slop 'em Up!

        Again, this is all for fun- don't take the criticisms or praise to heart, just screwing around... but I will win in the end ;)
