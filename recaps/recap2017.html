        So it's that time- you know the deal, here is a review of all of the
        teams drafts. Yahoo's draft grades are terrible and untrustworthy- mine
        are spot on- like really spot on- like check out last year's and you'll
        see the proof is in the pudding my friends. Let's get to it!
        <ul>
          <li class="space">
            <b>Great Whites - Ugly</b><br />
            Old old old, temporary players, and injuries.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>I Touchdown There - Ugly</b><br />
            Medicore RBs, One good WR, way too many Saints, two defenses?
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>On Yo Couch... - Bad</b><br />
            Nothing exciting but nothing terrible. A little weak at TE but late
            round flyers may scrape out some wins.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Goldust - Good</b><br />
            Borderline great/amazing, Top tier TE, big time TD scoring WRs, will
            see him in the Championship game.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Team Shiloh - Good</b><br />
            Good value throughout, no real weakness as long as Rivers keeps the
            INTs down (which he SHOULD finally have a healthy WR corps).
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Marcus McStuffins - Good</b><br />
            Solid value down the line with some possible sleepers there. Went
            with veterans with proven track records to round out roster in the
            late rounds.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Team Crawford - Bad</b><br />
            Too much stock in rookies, backups, and oft-injured. Got Lacy and
            Luck super late buuuut I don't think they'll ever get back to
            anything close to top tier in a while (if at all).
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>The Human Tornado - Ugly</b><br />
            Way too much faith in rookies (drafted way too high), back to back
            TE picks is a real head scratcher, defense is weak, and just
            overthinking how this league is played. John Ross will be a nice
            pick... next year.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Air Force Ones - Good</b><br />
            Witten that late pissed me off as I was going to take him there,
            pretty scary starting lineup potential. The streak of the Big 3
            continues with multiple representatives this year?
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>SS Balls - Good</b><br />
            Borderline bad because of being too high on Mixon (the one who
            knocksout girls in fast food restaurants), but Garcon is sneaky good
            pick and stole Corey Coleman from me plus helluva defense in KC.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>You Down with ADP - Ugly</b><br />
            Worst draft, maybe of all time? Greg Olsen as his first pick?!? Then
            two non-TD scoring WRs who are streaky to boot?!? Then backup RBs
            when your starter is suspended for how many games?!? Then a run on
            rookie WRs?!? Woof, I didn't think tanking would start this early.
          </li>

          <li class="space">
            <b>Skyscrapers - Amazing</b><br />
            I could go on and on about how good my... ok, who are we kidding, I
            am going to go on and on about how amazing my team is. The CHAMPION
            of last year RETURNS and builds an EVEN STRONGER team! How is that
            possible?? Well, the 49ers offense will be humming this year (to the
            shock of some), Tyreek Hill (who yes also beat up a pregnant gf a
            few years back) is still the fastest guy in the NFL, Cam Newton 61st
            overall?!?! Did you guys forget just two years ago and now his
            roster is stacked around him!?! #1 Defense somehow falls to 102, and
            late-round solid bye-week fillers... and Doug Martin, who yes, I
            mocked a couple of years ago but now is on a stacked TB offense that
            he will score a ton of points with starting week 5. Only blemish
            that MAY keep me from a perfect season is TE because of the robbery
            mentioned above.
          </li>
        </ul>
        This year I'm just giving you the straight division winners and the wild
        card team with playoffs- don't have the time to do all of the records...
        but here they are:
        <ul>
          <li class="space">
            <b>Div Champs:</b> Skyscrapers, Goldust, Air Force Ones
          </li>
          <li class="space"><b>Wildcard:</b> SS Balls</li>
          <li class="space">
            <b>Playoffs:</b><br />
            Skyscrapers defeats SS Balls<br />
            Goldust defeats Air Force Ones<br />
            Skyscrapers defeats Goldust by .1 points in the Championship to
            repeat!
          </li>
        </ul>
        Take that to the bank and cash it folks! (barring any roster moves, in
        which Tony will have only 2 original players on his team by the end of
        the year so who really knows what going to happen in those first two
        playoff rounds loser-wise :)
